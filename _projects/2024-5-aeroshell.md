The aeroshell has been my longest and most complex learning process from when I agreed to take the position of Composites Subteam Lead to when the product was cured. In terms of creation, fabrication, finding people to help, getting the steps right, and completion of the project there were so many mistakes and so many learning opportunities. It has been an agonizing pleasure to be in charge of this undertaking.

I came in knowing nothing and my predecessors either transferred to other teams or graduated. There was little to no documentation so I began researching how to create composite structures and networking with Composites Subteams on other Project Teams besides Hyperloop to get insight and assistance with the process.

Thankfully, the Ergonomics (Composites) Team Lead of Cornell Baja Racing taught me the layup process, gave me a roadmap for future use, and explained the materials needed. Everything lined up with what I had researched so it was going well. Even more fortunately, my predecessors had left me almost all the materials needed to do the job.  

From here I began my own prototyping. 
![Old Negative Mold]({{ "/assets/images/old-negative-mold.jpg" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-r style="width: 35%"}
This was Spring of 2024 and I had no underclassmen on my team to help me at that point. I 
found an old miniature negative (outer profile of what we want to create) mold as well as two miniature positive (inner profile as what we want to create) molds left by upperclassmen of the past. I practiced creating a layup surface like the one on the negative mold that was left, as well as laying up using that same mold.  

**Layup Process:**  
- Dry sand full surface to be smooth with 220 grit sandpaper
- Spray 5 layers of Duratec Surface Primer
- Wet sand Duratec grit by grit up until it’s smooth
    - 320→400→600→800→1000→1200→1500→2000
- Lay carbon fiber layer
    - Coat with 3:1 mixture of Epoxy to Cure
- Lay kevlar layer
    - Coat with mixture
- Lay carbon fiber layer
    - Coat with mixture
- Cover with perforated ply to wick excess epoxy out of fabric
- Cover with breather to absorb excess epoxy
- Place vacuume tube on top of breather and small slight hold through vacuum bag for vacuum nozzle to stick through
- Cover with vacuum bag and poke nozzle up through previously made hole
- Stick edges of vacuum bag to Mastic sealant tape and stick tape to table for airtight seal
- Activate vacuum pump and wait until you see full tight vacuum with air clearly evacuated from under vacuum bag
- Wait until cured  

Skipping ahead, the layup I did with
![Good vs Bad Surface Creation]({{ "/assets/images/negative1-vs-negative2.jpg" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-r style="width: 35%"}
the negative mold went very well. My attempt to create a good layup surface with the first positive mold; however, went poorly. I now know it is because I did not spray multiple layers of Duratec onto the high density foam and sand the combination down smooth. The more rough looking mold is actually better made by myself and the two underclassmen on my Subteam the following semester. The one in front is the one I made with only one pass of Duratec airbrushed onto it and you can somewhat see the green of the high density foam through the airbrushed layer of Duratec.  

I onboarded my new members by teaching them to create layup surface. We did a layup with the old negative mold as well as with our created positive mold. Here are images of the created layup surface (with chemicals used behind it), positive layup result, and negative layup results.

![Negative Layup]({{ "/assets/images/onboarding-negative-layup.jpg" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-1 style="width: 30%"}

Now that I understood the process for creating a positive mold I got started on plans for the full sized mock-up. I ordered large amounts of high density foam for our full-sized 9-foot long aeroshell. Cornell's Digital Design & Fabrication Studio (D2FS) and I also worked together to CNC the foam in several pieces because they could not do it all at once. So I cut my CAD file into 15 pieces, got each CNCed, and used a strong adhesive foam spray to keep everything together.
